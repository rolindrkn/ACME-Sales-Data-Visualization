# ACME-Sales-Data-Visualization
Explanatory Visualization that helps a sales manager decide with 3 products to discontinue

The Sales - Superstore dataset contains detailed information about your companyâ€™s sales. Your manager, Sylvia, has made a decision to cut the three worst performing sub-categories in their region in terms of Sales. To do this, she has asked you to create one data visualization that will identify which three sub-categories are the worst performers by region, and show how much worse they perform than other sub-categories. Sylvia will use this visualization to inform which product categories to cut, and in which regions.
